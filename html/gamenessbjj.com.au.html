<h2><strong>What makes a jiu-jitsu gi different from other martial arts gis? </strong></h2>
<p>At first glance a jiu-jitsu gi (bjj gi) looks much like a gi used in other martial arts such as Tae Kwon Do. But upon closer inspection, you will notice that the bjj gi is very different. A quality gi will be much more durable and have features such as triple stitching, a heavier collar, and reinforcements in key areas such as the knees. Bjj Gis also have patches that add style and color to the gi. A traditional TKD gi wouldn't last any time in a jiu-jitsu program. Spending a little more money on the right gi can save an embarrassing episode in your next Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu training session.</p>
<p>What's the difference between Bjj Gi weaves? Jiu-jitsu gis come in many weaves. A weave describes the process by which the cotton fabric is constructed. Some weaves are designed to be ultra-light weight, such as the Gameness Air Gi (a comb weave) and others are heavier double weaves such as the Gameness Platinum Gi (a gold weave).</p>
<p>A lighter bjj gi will help you hit your target weight before competition and provide for a more comfortable training session. A heavier jiu-jitsu gi can be almost indestructible and will last for a very long time. Some like the feel of a heavier gi while others like the freedom that a lighter weave gives them. You can also find weaves that are in-between, such as the pearl weave used in the Gameness Pearl Gi and Gameness Feather Gi.</p>
<p>In choosing a particular weave, it is important to consider variables like breathability, temperatures in which training takes place, and personal preference on fit and weight. A heavier weave is more traditional in BJJ. Some people prefer one weave for training and a different weave for competition.</p>

<h2><strong>What Color Bjj Gi should I get?</strong></h2>
<p>Most bjj gis are offered in white, blue and black. While most jiu-jitsu practitioners wear a white gi, a colored jiu jitsu gi can add a little flair and also hide dirt and stains more effectively. When selecting a color, you should consider what your training facility allows or simply select a white one to be safe. In certain schools, only advanced belts are allowed to wear a black gi, as an example. Tournament rules are also different but typically all three colors noted above are allowed for competition. Many people start with a white gi, and then purchase additional colors as their training progresses.</p>

<h2><strong>How do I care for my gi?</strong></h2>
<p>You definitely want to wash your jiu-jitsu gi after every training session, because gis take a beating and can get very dirty and sweaty even after just 45 minutes or an hour. Regular washing cuts down on the chances of spreading or contracting things like staph infection or ringworm.</p>
<p>When washing your bjj gi, always machine wash it in cold water, then hang it out to dry. This will keep your gi from shrinking and help it last longer. If you are absolutely pressed for time, it is ok to throw it in the dryer on air dry or very low heat, but be aware that this will break down the gi faster over time, and it could cause some shrinkage. Many people have at least 2 jiu-jitsu gis so they can alternate, always having one clean and dry and ready to go.</p>
<p>With a colored gi, check with the manufacturer to ensure that the color has been set through a mercerization process. For example, all of the Gameness gis have been through this process to set the color, which prevents running and fading over time.</p>
<p>To treat stains, use a non-bleach stain treatment. Bleach breaks down the cotton fabric and will shorten the life of your gi.</p>
<h2><strong>What about shrinkage?</strong></h2>
<p>Because quality bjj gis are made of 100% cotton, there is a chance that they will shrink. Manufacturers can tell you if their fabric has been pre-shrunk, which is a quality you should look for before purchasing a gi. All Gameness Gis are made with 100%, pre-shrunk cotton. If the gi has been pre-shrunk, it should hold its size if washed correctly (cold wash, air dry) with only modest shrinking over time.</p>
<p>Some people prefer to purchase a jiu-jitsu gi that is a little large, and then purposely shrink it to get a perfect fit. This can be done by washing the bjj gi in cold water, and then putting it in the dryer with heat for a few minutes at a time. Or, you can simply wet the areas you want to shrink (for example, if the arms are too long, you can wet the sleeves), and then put it in the dryer for a few minutes. Check the gi regularly by pulling it out of the dryer and putting it on. Once it shrinks to the right size, only air dry the gi. This process gives you a personalized, perfect fit.</p>

<h2><strong>How do I select the correct size in a Jiu-Jitsu Gi?</strong></h2>
<p>Once you have selected the gi that is right for you, it is time to pick the right size bjj gi for your height and weight. Gis come in men's sizes A1 (smallest) to A6 (largest), women's sizes F1-F5, and children's sizes 000 (smallest) to 1 (largest). The first place to start is with the manufacturer's sizing chart.</p>
